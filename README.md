# Number-Plate-and-speed-Detection-.
Using Python Modules, Open Cv and Yolo created a python code to detect number plate and speed between two camera.
THE FILES 'plate_number.xml' AND 'Video_model_reco_forced.PY' are the part of the next development in the project.
Previously our project was able to extract the vehicle no. along with time in two different camera c1 and c2 providing us with the speed.
Now we have developed the next phase in which the scripts opens the primary camera of device and then look for number plate/license.
After which it save the obtained information in an excel sheet or csv file along with timestamp.
However right now we are only able to get the timestamp right working on forced recognition to get the exact value of the number plate.
The script get all the value it suppose as a number plate information and then save it in csv file with corresponding timestamp.
